## Team members

### [Prof. Carlos Peña](https://people.hes-so.ch/en/profile/269853581-carlos-andres-pena)

PhD, HEIG-VD, Director of the Institute of Information and Communication Technologies (IICT)

![Team member](assets/images/pena.png){ width="200px", align=left }

Professor Peña has extensive expertise in Explainable 
Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Across several CTI and SNSF projects (DiagnoSuite, BossExplorer, 
nanoFUGE, ISyPeM) he has developed and successfully applied his interpretable modelling 
approach, dubbed *Fuzzy CoCo* and based on evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy logic, to several
diagnostic and biomarker-discovery tasks. Based on this algorithm he has published open-source 
packages (*Trefle*[^1], *fugeR*[^2]) and produced an unpublished package that led to the creation of
SimplicityBio, a company today integrated into Precision QuartzBio and that also led to the obtention
of a patent (WO/2017/199067).

From 2016 to 2018, with the project *"D-Rex: Rule extraction from
deep neural networks"*, (Hasler foundation grant)[^3], [^4], his group focused on the investigation of
knowledge extraction methods from deep neural networks (CNNs). The methods developed in this 
project were able to extract simple rules based on high-level features[^4], extract class-relevant
input features and highlight them in specific inputs [^4], and recreate prototypical images for specific
classes or internal features allowing users to gain insights into the inner representations of the 
trained network[^4].

Since 2020, the team participates to the SNSF NRP77 project *"EXPLaiN:
Ethical and Legal issues of Mobile Health Data – Improving understanding and eXPlainability of 
digitaL transformAtion and data technologies using artificial IntelligeNce"*, which focus on the
implementation and test of explainable models in the context of mobile health data.

### [Prof. Marcel Graf](https://people.hes-so.ch/en/profile/2002425133-marcel-graf)

PhD, HEIG-VD

![Team member](assets/images/graf.png){ width="200px", align=left }

Professor Graf has more than 20 years of experience in 
software engineering, including 16 years at IBM Research. He has developed digital platforms that 
give structure to technical expertise and make it available to a broader non-technical audience[^5].
In an Innosuisse project with *Avalia Systems* he has developed a platform that allows experts in
software engineering to organise and streamline their work in software assessments and 
communicate their insights to business clients. The platform can be flexibly deployed on Avalia's or 
the client's IT. In another Innosuisse project with *Flybotix* he is developing a cloud-based platform
for drone inspection flights. The platform uses short-lived massive cloud resources for 
photogrammetric processing with low latency and enables remote inspection experts to follow and 
supervise a drone flight remotely.

### [Prof. Guido Bologna](https://people.hes-so.ch/en/profile/33748034-guido-bologna)

PhD, HEPIA-GE

![Team member](assets/images/bologna.png){ width="200px", align=left }

Professor Bologna introduced a neural network model 
from which propositional rules are generated [^6]. These rules are natural with respect to the logic
of human reasoning. A clear advantage of the introduced model, which is called *Discretized
Interpretable Multi Layer Perceptron (DIMLP)* is that for a given input, we can refer the activated
rules and determine range inputs relevant to the decision. Later, the DIMLP transparency framework 
was applied to ensembles [^7]. A rule extraction technique that is essential to the explicability of deep
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) was presented in [^8]. Subsequently, a comprehensive comparison
of rule extraction techniques was proposed for 25 classification problems [^9]. The compared models
were ensembles of DIMLPs, ensembles of decision trees and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). 
Finally, in [^10] the rule extraction problem was tackled from a simple convolutional architecture with
respect to textual data and melanoma images [^11]. Many of about 100 papers he has authored or
co-authored are available on ResearchGate [^12].
