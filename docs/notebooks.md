# :material-notebook: Use cases notebooks

Welcome to the notebook section, dedicated to showcase Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques in various use cases.

These notebooks aim to make XAI more approachable by providing practical examples and explanations. We have curated a diverse range of notebooks for audiences with varying levels of expertise.

Explore our collection of notebooks to understand how AI models make decisions, interpret their outputs, and gain insights into their predictions.

## Sport Image Classification

Through this use case, we aim to empower users to grasp the potential of CAM as a tool for transparent and interpretable sport image classification.

    In this use case, we dive into sport image classification and showcase the power of **Class Activation Maps** (CAM) as an
    interpretability tool.

    CAM allows us to visualize the regions of an image that contribute most to the model's classification decision.
    By overlaying **heatmaps** onto the original images, we gain insights into the model's attention and its understanding of different sports.

While focusing on a specific image classification task using a pre-trained model,  our goal is to demonstrate how XAI empowers users to explore and interpret image classifiers effectively.

By the end of this use case, you will have a solid understanding of CAM and how to integrate it into your own sport image classification projects.
