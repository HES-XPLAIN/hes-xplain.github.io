## Easy-to-use platform

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into essential sectors like healthcare, finance, and legal systems. However, users ooften rely on AI-generated decisions without fully understanding the underlying mechanisms and reasoning, which can lead to trust issues. This concern is particularly acute when decisions carry significant consequences.

eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) seeks to enhance the clarity and trustworthiness of AI decisions by elucidating the logic behind predictions. Despite advancements in this field, many existing XAI tools remain complex and challenging to use.

Our platform aims to address this challenge by making XAI more accessible to all users. We provide an intuitive, open-source environment that consolidates various XAI techniques helping users to better understand and apply AI insights effectively.

## Benefits

HES-XPLAIN brings several benefits to its users:

- **Accessibility**: Makes XAI tools and techniques accessible to everyone, from beginners to experts.
- **Ease of Use**: User-friendly interface and comprehensive resources simplify the application of XAI.
- **Educational Value**: Facilitates the teaching and learning of XAI through tutorials and guides.
- **Versatility**: Supports various data types and integrates multiple XAI methods for comprehensive analysis.
