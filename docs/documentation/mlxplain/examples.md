# Examples and Use Cases

In this section, you'll find various resources to help you get started with the `MLxplain` library and explore its full potential through practical examples and use cases.

You can get started with the `MLxplain` using and exploring two use cases: 

- [Aptos 2019 Blindness Detection Use Case](../../notebooks.md#aptos-2019-blindness-detection)
- [Use dimlpfidex within the OmniXAI library](../../notebooks.md#use-dimlpfidex-within-the-omnixai-library)

In these use cases, we show how to use our methods and tools through the omnixai explainers and explanations modules, this adaptation is done by the `MLxplain` library and the omnixai-community package.
