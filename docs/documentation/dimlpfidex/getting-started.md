# Getting started

!!!Warning
    **This section is under construction and should not be considered as accurate yet.**

In order for you to get started as fast as possible in the field of XAI, here is a plan to follow:

1. Install our algorithms following the [installation guide](../installation-guide.md).
2. (Optional) Install our user interface following the [GUI](gui.md) page.
3. Take a moment to follow one of our [notebooks](). Here is a selection for you to dive into the use of `dimlpfidex` tools:
