# Getting started

To help you get started quickly in the field of XAI, specifically using the dimlpfidex algorithms, here is a recommended plan to follow:

1. Install our algorithms following the [installation guide](../installation-guide.md).
2. (Optional) Install our user interface following the [GUI](gui.md) page.
3. Take a moment to follow one of our [notebooks](../../notebooks.md). Here is a selection for you to dive into the use of `dimlpfidex` tools:
