## Application domains
Our tools can be used to bring explainability across a wide range of domains, including but not limited to:

- :material-medical-bag: **Healthcare**: Explainable algorithms can improve diagnostic tools by providing transparent decision-making processes, helping clinicians understand and trust the outputs, which can lead to better patient outcomes.

- :material-finance: **Finances**: Explainable algorithms offer transparency in risk assessment and trading strategies, enabling financial professionals to understand the factors driving model predictions and make more informed decisions.

- :material-chart-arc: **Marketing**: By offering insights into customer segmentation and behavior analysis, our algorithms help marketers understand the underlying reasons behind customer trends, leading to more effective and targeted marketing strategies.

- :material-hammer-wrench: **Engineering**: Explainability in engineering models allows for better system design and optimization by providing clear insights into how various factors influence the model's predictions, facilitating more reliable and robust engineering solutions.

- :material-test-tube: **Research**: Our tools aid in data analysis and hypothesis testing by making the model's decision processes transparent, which helps researchers validate their findings and ensure the reliability of their studies.
