|:------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rule                           | Logical statement defining conditions based on input data to predict a specific class.   |
| Local Rule                     | Rule explaining the model's prediction for a specific data sample by focusing on the conditions relevant to that particular instance.    |
| Global rule                    | Rule providing a general explanation of the model's behavior across the entire dataset.  |
| Antecedent                     | A condition or statement in a rule that must be true for the rule to be activated.       |
| Fidel/Fidelity                 | Measures how well a rule or a set of rules aligns with the modelâ€™s predictions.          |
| Accuracy                       | Proportion of correctly predicted classes compared to the total number of predictions.   |
| Covered samples                | Set of data samples that satisfy the conditions of a specific rule.                      |
| Discriminant hyperplanes       | Boundaries in the feature space that separate different classes based on the conditions defined by a model.  |
