# Introduction

Our open-source platform, HES-XPLAIN, is designed to help democratize access to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for diverse audiences. We provide an easy-to-use platform 
where users can access resources to enhance their understanding, including datasets, models for experimentation, and easy-to-apply XAI algorithms. Data scientists can use 
HES-XPLAIN to train and test their machine learning models, while decision makers can access resources to guide their XAI choices. We have also developed this platform to 
facilitate the teaching of XAI through a series of tutorials and comprehensive how-to guides.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into essential sectors like healthcare, finance, and legal systems. However, users of these tools often find themselves 
having to rely on decisions made by the AI without fully understanding the mechanisms involved, which can raise issues of trust. This problem becomes particularly worrying when 
these decisions have significant consequences. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI decisions clear and trustworthy by showing the logic behind AI 
predictions. Despite progress in the field, many people still find it challenging to use XAI because the tools are often complex and not user-friendly.

Our platform, HES-XPLAIN, aims to change this by making XAI more accessible to everyone. It provides an easy-to-use, open-source environment that brings together different XAI 
techniques. In addition, our platform includes our own methods designed to extend AI explanations and is integrated with the OmniXAI library, which allows for effective comparisons 
and supports many data types. HES-XPLAIN deploys ready-to-use tools that allow users to easily try out and implement XAI methods. This overview discusses how HES-XPLAIN works, what 
it offers, and how it makes XAI more accessible to data scientists, decision makers, and educators. We show the crucial role that HES-XPLAIN plays in making AI more transparent and 
easier to understand for everyone.


HES-XPLAIN brings several benefits to its users:

- **Accessibility**: Makes XAI tools and techniques accessible to everyone, from beginners to experts.
- **Ease of Use**: User-friendly interface and comprehensive resources simplify the application of XAI.
- **Educational Value**: Facilitates the teaching and learning of XAI through tutorials and guides.
- **Versatility**: Supports various data types and integrates multiple XAI methods for comprehensive analysis.


HES-XPLAIN is an open platform for accelerating the development of eXplainable AI systems. By making XAI tools more accessible and user-friendly, we aim to enhance the transparency 
and trustworthiness of AI systems across different sectors. Whether you are a data scientist, decision maker, or educator, HES-XPLAIN offers the resources and tools you need to 
understand and apply XAI effectively.
