# Introduction

Our open-source platform, **HES-XPLAIN**, is designed to democratize access to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for diverse audiences. We provide an easy-to-use platform where users can access resources to enhance their understanding, including datasets, models for experimentation, and easy-to-apply XAI algorithms.

## Key Users

- **Data Scientists**: Use HES-XPLAIN to train and test machine learning models.
- **Decision Makers**: Access resources to guide XAI choices.
- **Educators**: Facilitate the teaching of XAI through tutorials and comprehensive guides.

## The Need for Explainable AI

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into essential sectors like healthcare, finance, and legal systems. However, users often rely on AI decisions without fully understanding the mechanisms involved, raising trust issues. This problem becomes particularly worrying when decisions have significant consequences.

### The Role of XAI

eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI decisions clear and trustworthy by showing the logic behind AI predictions. Despite progress in the field, many find XAI tools complex and not user-friendly.

## HES-XPLAIN's Solution

Our platform aims to change this by making XAI more accessible to everyone. HES-XPLAIN provides an easy-to-use, open-source environment that brings together different XAI techniques.

### Integration with OmniXAI

In addition to our methods, HES-XPLAIN integrates with the OmniXAI library, allowing for effective comparisons and supporting many data types. HES-XPLAIN deploys ready-to-use tools that enable users to easily try out and implement XAI methods.

## Benefits of HES-XPLAIN

HES-XPLAIN brings several benefits to its users:

- **Accessibility**: Makes XAI tools and techniques accessible to everyone, from beginners to experts.
- **Ease of Use**: User-friendly interface and comprehensive resources simplify the application of XAI.
- **Educational Value**: Facilitates the teaching and learning of XAI through tutorials and guides.
- **Versatility**: Supports various data types and integrates multiple XAI methods for comprehensive analysis.
