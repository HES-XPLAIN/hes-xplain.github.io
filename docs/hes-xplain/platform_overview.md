# Platform Overview


## Algorithms

HES-XPLAIN assembles our own developed algorithms as well as incorporating all algorithms proposed by [OmniXAI](https://github.com/salesforce/omnixai). Our platform provides a 
comprehensive suite of tools for XAI, enabling users to compare and choose the best techniques for their needs. Explore our algorithms in the [HES-XPLAIN - Algorithms](../algos/) 
section.

## Resources and Tutorials

We offer multiple resources to enhance XAI knowledge, including:

- **Tutorial Notebooks**: Step-by-step guides to help users understand and apply XAI methods.
- **Use Case Notebooks**: Showcase how XAI and our platform can be used to solve real-world problems.
- **Datasets and Models**: Embedded datasets and pre-trained models to facilitate experimentation.

## Deployment Options

HES-XPLAIN provides flexible deployment options to suit different user needs:

- **Google Colab**: Online deployment through Google Colab for easy access and experimentation.
- **Docker**: Local deployment using Docker files to try our solutions locally with minimal setup.
