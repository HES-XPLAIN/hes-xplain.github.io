# Get Started

We aim to provide **an open XAI-oriented platform** allowing to compare **explainability algorithms** at both low and
high levels of abstraction, allowing to better **explain complex behaviours**.

## Who is this project for?

## An open XAI platform

We aim to provide **an open XAI-oriented platform** coming with explainability to connectionist models, including neural
networks and their ensembles, as well as DL architectures.

It will include a **selection of well-known and widely-used XAI approaches** from the literature,
as well as **XAI algorithms coming from our own research**.

### Components
The platform consists of:

- [x] A web site introducing the topic of explainable AI to industry partners and educators
- [x] Sample use cases with storytelling, datasets, models and explanations that enable data scientists to experiment
- [x] Automated packaging of software components that are easily installable using widely-used package managers
- [x] Automated packaging of a notebook server and preconfigured notebooks in container images
- [x] Deployment manifests that enable quick deployment of the platform on a dedicated server or cluster, suitable for a private environment or a public
cloud.
