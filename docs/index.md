# XPLAIN

***An open platform for accelerating the development of eXplainable AI systems***

*by [HES-SO](./team) - University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland*

***

We aim to provide **an open XAI-oriented platform** allowing data scientists to train or
deploy their predictive models and then apply and compare **explainability algorithms** at both low and
high levels of abstraction, allowing to better **explain complex behaviours**.


!!! tip inline end "XPLAIN in summary"

Explaining complex models involves dealing with different levels of abstraction.

* **Low-level explanations** capture fundamental relationships between input features.
* **High-level explanations** uncover higherabstraction patterns and relationships and present them
in an intelligible form.

The proposed platform comes with explainability to connectionist models, including neural
networks and their ensembles, as well as DL architectures.

It will include a **selection of well-known and widely-used XAI approaches** from the literature,
as well as **XAI algorithms coming from our own research**.
