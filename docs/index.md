# Welcome

An open platform for accelerating the development of eXplainable AI systems.

## Purpose

We aim to build an XAI-oriented platform allowing data science practitioners to
train or deploy their predictive models and then apply and compare different
explainability algorithms at both low and high levels of abstraction.

We will include XAI algorithms coming from our own research, as well as a
selection of well-known and widely used approaches from the literature.
Explaining complex models involves dealing with different levels of abstraction.
Low-level explanations capture fundamental relationships between input features.
High-level explanations uncover more-complex patterns and relationships and
present them in an intelligible form.
